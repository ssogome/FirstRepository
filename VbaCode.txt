/************Action commands in Visual Basic can only carry out actions. This includes queries, or SQL statements that represent queries. The reason you are getting the error is probably
because the SQL statement you are dealing with does not constitute an action.Action queries are: UPDATE, DELETE, APPEND, and MAKE TABLE. These are the only ones that can be used in Visual
 Basic with the Docmd.RunSQL and CurrentDB.Execute commands.********/
